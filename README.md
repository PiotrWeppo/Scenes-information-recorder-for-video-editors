# <p style="text-align: center;">Scenes information recorder for film editors</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Project under development.</p>

This project is designed to make work easier for film production or post-production editors. The program is intended to read frames from the film and collect relevant information about the scenes, such as:

- Information about the VFX effect to be added to the scene,
- Information about the ADR effect to be added to the scene,
- The time range of the entire scene in which the VFX appears,
- The actual time range of the entire scene in which VFX appears (from the beginning of the movie),
- The time range within the scene during which the ADR effect occurs,
- Actual time range within the scene (from the beginning of the movie) during which the ADR effect occurs.

After reviewing the entire movie, an Excel file is generated, with a summary of the processed information, and thumbnails of the scenes in which VFX effects occur.
